Case Series: These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.

Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis in Cancer Patients with COVID-19: a Single Center's Retrospective Study.

Case Series: Through two cases of immunocompromised patients with newly diagnosed head and neck malignancies, we aim to provide guidance to clinicians struggling with how to best counsel and manage this unique subset of patients under these difficult circumstances. RESULTS: After careful consideration of the options, we took different approaches in the care of these two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, there is no uniform set of rules to apply to this heterogeneous group of immune-compromised patients.

Results
Study selection      
Studies were selected from LitCovid at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/ as of the date 4/20/2020. The key word “cancer patient” was typed for initial search on this website. There were 1796 studies shown from the result on LitCovid. Those papers were downloaded and imported to ASReview for further narrowing down. When reviewing the 1796 papers, the topics and abstracts were reviewed and the papers were categorized as relevant papers if it is shown as cancer related. Excluded transplant and surgical treatment, solely focused on cancer patients identifiers through narrowing down process. After reviewing 1796 studies, there were 132 papers that were actually related to cancer patients and were selected for further detailed review. 
 
Study characteristics
The studies within the 132 selected papers. Population is patients diagnosed with one of the cancers excluded skin and thyroid. Location. were range from Europe, US and China. The studies were categorized into insight(18/65), guideline(6/65), care management(22/65), literature review(3/65), recommendation(2/65). There were 15/65 papers that needs more detailed reviews which hopefully can provide some sort of more specific insights.

“COVID-19 Health System Updates”  
Extract the case numbers in these letters, and make a time-series graph for the # of COVID-19-positive patients in our hospitals, # of patients in our ICUs, # of inpatients under investigation (PUIs)  
At one point, the letter also give the # of PPEs , # of hospital beds, # of ventilators.   
Summary: peak at 1962 pisitive on 4/13/2020
