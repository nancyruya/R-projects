# R-projects with Dr. Liu

1. Partnership project with Dr. Coakley and his medical student Megan looking for associations between political partisanship, at the state level, and differences in measures of pediatric health and safety
- State-Level Partisanship Strongly Correlates with Health Outcomes for US Children
Partison outcome

1st graph: regression, show each variable and its beta coef and p-value (ASC)
2nd graph: look at the difference between two value using box plot
Box plot compare really republican and really democrats
Moderate rebulican and moderate democrats

2. Partnership project with Dr. Coakley and his medical student Amanda looking at Firearm Mortality

3. Geographically Weighted Regression
4. Literature review for Covid-19, focusing on studies that use survey(in-person, on-line) to look at different impact of Covid-19.

- prority is the survey study, look at impact, any publicable impact?
- knowledge, attitute, mental health, guidelines, how practice social distancing?

- Group the 300is paper and narrow done
- Look at Mortality rate among cancer pt, clinical characterastic/ICU admition rate, % of recory, how many ventilator used, length of stay, or other aspect of cancer. 
- Maybe use 15 papers, or maybe look at medication?


# Linear Regression

Crude Model
Y(AllMortAdj)=f(ATFRegWeapon)
Adjusted model
Y(AllMortAdj)=f(ATFRegWeapon, Poverty, Unemploy, PoorMH0,PoorMH14ls, PoorMH14gt, StPoP)
